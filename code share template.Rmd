# Introduction   

This template is designed to help you share your code with others in a clear and organized way. As you use this template, please keep a few things in mind:

## Comments    
Make sure to use comments to explain what your code is doing. This will help others understand your code and will also help you remember what you were doing if you come back to it later.

## Markdown language formatting   
Use markdown to format your code and add explanations. This will make your code easier to read and understand. Some examples of markdown you can use include:
  - Headers: Use `#` to create headers
  - Lists: Use `*` to create bullet points
  - Links: Use `[text](url)` to create links
  - Images: Use `![](url)` to include images
  - Code: Use backticks to include code snippets
  
## Code chunks
Use separate code chunks for each step of your code. This will make your code easier to read and understand. You can also use code chunks to include plots and other visualizations.

## Chunk options  
Use chunk options to control how your code is displayed. Some examples of chunk options you can use include:
  - `echo = FALSE`: Prevents printing of the R code that generated
  - `eval = FALSE`: Prevents running of the R code
  - `include = FALSE`: Prevents printing of the R code and the results
  - `message = FALSE`: Prevents printing of messages generated by the R code
  - `warning = FALSE`: Prevents printing of warnings generated by the R code
  
## Markdown settings  
I've included the options I usually use in lines 5-9, but please feel free to adjust them as you see fit. You can find more information about markdown settings [here](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/html_document_format.html).

# Setup  
This chunk is for your setup code. You can set global chunk options, load libraries, and write custom functions here. 
```{r setup, include=TRUE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
	echo = TRUE,
	message = FALSE,
	warning = FALSE,
	cache = TRUE
)

# Load libraries
## mapping libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(sf)
library(leaflet)
library(ggplot2)


```

## Data processing  
Use this chunk to load and process data. You may need multiple data processing chunks, depending on the complexity of your code. 
```{r data_processing}


```

## Figures

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```
